The Reytons are a rising force in British indie rock, known for their gritty authenticity and chart-topping success. Emerging from Rotherham, England, The Reytons have carved a distinct path in the UK music scene since their formation in 2017. Comprising frontman Jonny Yerrell, guitarist Joe O'Brien, bassist Lee Holland, and drummer Jamie Todd, the band quickly gained traction with their raw energy and relatable lyrics. Their debut album, Kids Off the Estate, released in November 2021, resonated with fans and critics alike, debuting at number eleven on the UK Albums Chart. They followed this with What's Rock and Roll? in January 2023, which marked a major milestone by reaching number one on the chart.

What sets The Reytons apart is their DIY ethos—they achieved mainstream success without major label backing, relying instead on grassroots support and relentless touring. Their third album, Ballad Of A Bystander, released in January 2024, continued their momentum, sparking a fierce chart battle with pop artist James Arthur. The band’s lyrics often reflect working-class life, capturing the spirit of Northern England with wit and grit. Their rise from local gigs to headlining major festivals like Tramlines in Sheffield is a testament to their growing influence and loyal fanbase.
